  Implemented Machine Learning Classification Models for Mnist Dataset. 
  
  
  About Mnist Dataset - The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems and also in the field of Machine Learning. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
  
  1. Random Forest - is a popular Machine Learning Algorithm that belongs to supervised learning technique. It can be used for both classification and regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ENSEMBLE LEARNING, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model. It is a classifier that cpntains the number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that datatset. Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions and it predicts the final output
